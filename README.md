# RedditScraper
Study repo. Using web scraping techniques to extract data publicly available on Reddit. <br>
Content analysis will be conducted through the [Go API](https://github.com/Serinolli/scraper-api) that I am currently developing

### The application aims to conduct periodic analyses of posted topics on r/programming, without constant or excessive data collection, with the goal of identifying and understanding trending topics

To test it, just run:
```
npm i
```

```
npm run start
```
